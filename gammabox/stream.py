"""Capture the Geiger counter readings and dispatch them
to the web app frontend and the forwarder.
Ideally we should have this in a separate program, so we can
reliably monitore the Geiger counter. This program would then
forward the readings using a broker (like ZeroMQ) to a backend
service (to store and forward the messages) and a frontend
service (to broadcast them). That way the reading part will
be less sensitive to issues from the backend or frontend processes.
